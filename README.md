In the first exercise, we were tasked with creating a triangle, and ellipse, and another shape of our choosing. I chose a pentagon
Each shape had to be drawn with a function that accepted positional parameters. The link to the sketch is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/ux-m7mLMn

The second exercise had us modify our previous shapes sketch to add RGB color parameters to the function. This allowed us to change 
the color of the shape through the function. The link to the sketch is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/u28X9qHoA

Finally, we had to create a new sketch that uses a function to draw a sprite of our choice that included parameters for the position,
the size, and the color of the shape. Additionally, the sprite had to swap out with another sprite with the same available parameters when 
the mouse is pressed down. The link to the sketch is here: https://editor.p5js.org/connorL/sketches/8ALtZ49ME
